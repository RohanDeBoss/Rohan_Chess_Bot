#region ** V2 PROGRESS COMMENTS **

// { v2 Progression: }
// 1. Improved performance of Move sorting by ~86% (1 million now in ~55ms instead of ~850ms)
// 2. Improved performance of Evaluation by ~23% (1 million now in ~650ms instead of ~870ms)
// -> Also tried a bitboard version, which would save all of the square pre calculations, but would be less performant (Would be good for tokens) -> 16
// 3. Tried to optimize the positioning bitboard tables, by comparing matches against stockfish and against the previous version. The optimizations I found were rather small here afaik.
// 4. Improved the move sorting by differentiating between three different move types: Captures, Pieces which are getting attacked by an enemy piece, and others. (Since 12 deleted)
// 5. Tried to implement sliding piece bitboards, to evaluate more active pieces higher, which turned out to not end up successfully, since the current positional evaluation doesnt cooperate with it smoothly.
// -> For the bishop this technique seemed to be okayish, so I tried around with many different algebraic functions and square combinations, which all were worse than the current system.
// 6. Since the token limit got exceeded by quite a lot now, I tried to save some here and there. The code should be quite compact now.
// 7. Fixed a very bad bug with the special quioscience search extension, where all scenerious got played further. This fixes now some bad blunders and increases the depth of many searches.
// -> Additionally it looks now up to 12 moves into that specific action instead of only 1
// 8. Reworked the sorting function on a way where it stays with its performance, but saves 10 tokens. (Since the 3 parts update the sorting is at ~210ms)
// 9. After figuring out the problem with negating the max value of an int; Ive switched to the negamax algorithm, to save a lot of code and being able to put the sort function inside of the minimax function itself
// -> As well as deleting the extra Minimax call; which required to add iterative deepening even to the first move the bot plays
// 10. Lookup Table for best move of already calculated nodes (PV-Nodes)
// -> This was for some reason worse than without (also with storing the three best moves per node or by finding the doubled evaluations in a dictionary and not evaluating again) Espacially the last is wondering me. -> 15
// 11. Added actual quiescense search (Also tried out to evaluate a checked position not as quiet, which was not really good for some reason) -> solution at 13
// 12. Added history heuristic and some stuff related to that about the timing to make it work better
// 13. Added Check Extensions for the standard Minimax Function
// 14. Tried to add Countermove Heuristic, which didnt seemed to pay off (Was pretty much equal)
// 15. Successfully implemented a transposition table by storing the beta cutoffs as well
// 16. After optimizing the raw bitboard positional evaluation idea (2) as far as I could, I was able to shave off around 40ms/mil and additionally gain a lot of tokens due to the removal of almost all precalculations
// -> At this point I was interested in getting a small benchmark of how good it is compared to v1 and it played 20 matches against it and has gotten 18|1|1
// 17. Tried a lot of different extensions for the evaluation, including Mobility, Kings Safety (multiple approaches) and Passed Pawns, from which I could only realistically take one. So Ive tried them all and it seemed like passed pawns give me the best result.
// -> This made my tokens not really managable anymore, so I needed to remove the rng opening feature & optimize a lot of minor minor things in terms of code reductions (This seems now like the limit of features I personally can fit into the 1024 tokens)
// -> And then I made a 60 game test and it went 21/20/19, compared to the non passed pawn thing, so I will continue now with different stuff :/ (all of this might be due to the bug Ive fixed in 22, but I had now already a pretty clear direction in which I want to go with the bot: small evaluation, big search)
// 18. Since all my tries to make the evaluation better failed, I worked further on my search. First I tried the classic killer heuristic with 3 moves per save, which turned out to not be useful enough.
// 19. Implemented Late Move Reductions (a bit different than usually implemented, but it worked best like that for me)
// 20. Implemented Null Move Pruning for all non TT Moves & only for positions with more than 1 move option
// 21. Implemented Delta Pruning for the Quiescence Search
// 22. Fixed a really bad bug in the evaluation function (because of forgetting to set two bracket pairs)
// 23. Added Evaluation for the pawn structure since that was possible with the rest of my tokens and slightly incrasing its playing strength
// 24. Since the positional 64-bits values all were off before, I reworked them quite a lot
// -> Now by comparing against Komodo21 which is rated 2500, it wins => so the v2 will have probably a rating of 2550 or so
